# Deactivated!!!
The server that runs this website has been deactivated because server costs are just too damn high!!

However, all the server code has been posted in this github so if you want to see what this program looks like in action, go ahead and test it out and run it in nodejs.

# LAHacks2018

Alrightt so I have all this code but I realized I don't even have instructions on how to use this!!!
<br>
<br>
To play, get some friends to play with together (or open up multiple tabs if you don't have friends like me!!) and go on this link: https://ryabn.github.io/LAHacks2018/

<br>
Enter your name and for the game code, enter 'host' (all lower case no space) and press enter. This will enter you into a game lobby and generate a game code. Get your friends to enter their names and enter the game code (case-sensitive) and join the lobby. You should see their names pop up if they join in the lobby screen.
<br>
<br>
<br>
### please do not enter the same name because this will cause errors and I haven't had the time to work on this bug (probably generate a unique code for every user)

anyways, when you're all gathered around and ready to play, the host should press the very big and obvious green button to start.

<br>
<br>

The coding challenge will be in javascript and if there are syntax or runtime errors, you will not see any output. However, if you have logic mistakes, the output will display your output and whether or not it's correct.
<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that I straight up did this in one hackathon in like 15 hours and with like no sleep so there are some bugs and the server code is NOT optimized and if you have like a billion people playing, i'm sorry 
<br>
<br>
I'll try to fix it soon. There are currently 5 problems and so far it's pretty much just a POC and I'll straighten out all the bugs later!!! thanks for checking out my project.


<br>
<br>

also there s a secret code and it's 'clearAllGames' which if you enter it into the game code in the login screen, it will clear all the server data so if your games are lagging ro something, do that (not in the middle of the game or else it will crash)
